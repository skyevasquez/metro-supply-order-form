## 🚀 Next Steps - What YOU Need to Do

### 1. Create Firebase Project (15 minutes)
Follow the instructions in `SETUP.md` starting from Step 1:
- Create project in Firebase Console
- Register web app
- Enable Authentication
- Enable Firestore
- Generate service account key

### 2. Configure Environment Variables (5 minutes)
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
- Fill in Firebase credentials from Firebase Console
- Add your existing email settings

### 3. Initialize Firebase CLI (5 minutes)
```bash
# Install Firebase CLI globally
npm install -g firebase-tools

# Login to Firebase
firebase login

# Initialize Firebase in your project
firebase init
```

Follow the prompts in `SETUP.md` Step 10.

### 4. Deploy Firestore Rules (2 minutes)
```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore
```

### 5. Create Test Users (1 minute)
```bash
npm run test:users
```

This creates three test accounts you can use immediately.

### 6. Start Development Server (1 minute)
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 7. Test the Application (5 minutes)
1. Open `http://localhost:3000/auth.html`
2. Login with: `employee@metrobytmobile.com` / `Employee123!`
3. Submit a test order
4. Check your email!

---

## 🎓 Test Credentials

Once you run `npm run test:users`, you'll have:

**Employee Account:**
- Email: `employee@metrobytmobile.com`
- Password: `Employee123!`
- Store: ARCHER

**Manager Account:**
- Email: `manager@metrobytmobile.com`
- Password: `Manager123!`
- Store: ARCHER

**Admin Account:**
- Email: `admin@metrobytmobile.com`
- Password: `Admin123!`
- All stores access

## 📊 How It Works Now

### User Journey

1. **Visit the site** → Redirected to `/auth.html` (login page)
2. **Sign in or register** → Firebase Authentication validates credentials
3. **Redirect to main app** → `/index.html` (order form)
4. **User info loaded** → Name and store pre-filled from Firebase profile
5. **Submit order** → Sent to backend with Firebase auth token
6. **Backend verifies** → Checks Firebase token for security
7. **Save to Firestore** → Order stored in database with user info
8. **Send email** → Enhanced template with user details
9. **Email received** → Recipient sees who submitted with contact info

### Authentication Flow

```
┌─────────────┐
│  auth.html  │ ← User not authenticated
└──────┬──────┘
       │ Login/Register
       ↓
┌─────────────────┐
│ Firebase Auth   │ → Creates/validates user
└──────┬──────────┘
       │ Success
       ↓
┌─────────────────┐
│  index.html     │ → Main app (authenticated)
└──────┬──────────┘
       │ Submit order
       ↓
┌─────────────────┐
│  Backend API    │ → Verifies token, saves to Firestore
└──────┬──────────┘
       │
       ↓
┌─────────────────┐
│  Email + DB     │ → Notification sent, data persisted
└─────────────────┘
```

### Data Flow

```
User Authentication
       ↓
Firebase Auth (uid, email, displayName)
       ↓
Firestore Users Collection (profile data)
       ↓
Order Submission
       ↓
Backend Verification (Firebase Admin SDK)
       ↓
Firestore Orders Collection (order + user info)
       ↓
Email Notification (enhanced with user details)
```

## 📝 Important Notes

### Files to NEVER Commit
🔐 `.env` - Environment variables  
🔐 `serviceAccountKey.json` - Firebase credentials  
✅ Already added to `.gitignore`

### User Roles Explained

**Employee (Default)**
- Can create orders for their assigned store
- Can view their own orders
- Cannot view other employees' orders

**Manager**
- All employee permissions
- Can view all orders for their store
- Can update order status for their store
- Cannot access other stores

**Admin**
- Full access to everything
- Can manage users
- Can view/edit all orders
- Can manage stores
- Use sparingly!

### Changing User Roles

```bash
# Make someone an admin
npm run set:role employee@metrobytmobile.com admin

# Make someone a manager
npm run set:role user@example.com manager

# Demote back to employee
npm run set:role admin@metrobytmobile.com employee
```

**Note:** Users must sign out and sign back in for role changes to take effect.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Firebase configuration not found"
**Fix:** Make sure you've created `.env` file with all Firebase values from Firebase Console.

### "Authentication failed"
**Fix:** 
1. Check Firebase Console → Authentication → Email/Password is enabled
2. Verify test users exist (run `npm run test:users` again)
3. Try resetting password in Firebase Console

### "Permission denied" in Firestore
**Fix:** Deploy security rules: `firebase deploy --only firestore`

### Email not sending
**Fix:** Check your Gmail App Password in `.env` file

### Module import errors
**Fix:** Make sure you're using a local server (not opening HTML directly). Run `npm run dev`.

---

## 🚢 Deployment Options

### Option 1: Firebase Hosting (Recommended)
```bash
npm run firebase:deploy:hosting
```
Your app at: `https://YOUR-PROJECT-ID.web.app`

### Option 2: Continue with Existing Server
Keep using your current hosting, Firebase works the same!

### Option 3: Vercel (Serverless)
Your existing Vercel setup still works with Firebase!
